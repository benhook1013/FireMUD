# Velero Backups

This directory contains Kubernetes manifests for installing Velero and scheduling PostgreSQL backups for the FireMUD cluster.

The `schedule.yaml` file defines three backup schedules matching the retention policy described in the architecture docs.

Apply the manifests with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f schedule.yaml -n velero
```

Ensure Velero is installed and configured with access to your object storage bucket prior to applying the schedule.
