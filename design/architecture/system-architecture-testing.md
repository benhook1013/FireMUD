# FireMUD System Architecture: Testing Strategy

FireMUD employs a layered testing approach to keep services reliable while avoiding excessive CI/CD costs. This document describes the scope of each test type, the tooling in use, and how these tests fit into our development workflow.

---

## Testing Scope

Each microservice has its own unit and integration tests. Cross‑service scenarios are also covered in a dedicated suite. Load tests run independently using Gatling in a separate `load-testing` module. The cross‑service directories contain example tests that can be expanded as needed.

- **Unit tests** live under each service in `src/test/java/unit/`.
- **Integration tests** for that service live in `src/test/java/integration/` and may start Redis, Postgres, or other dependencies on demand.
- **Cross-service integration tests** exercise workflows that span multiple services. They live under `src/test/java/crossservice/` in each service and start companion containers with Testcontainers. Docker images for the cooperating services must be built (for example via `./gradlew buildDockerImages`) or pulled from GHCR. A unified `crossServiceTest` Gradle task runs them collectively, or run `./gradlew :service-name:test --tests "*CrossServiceIntegrationTest"`.
- Many of these tests are annotated with `@Testcontainers(disabledWithoutDocker = true)` so they are skipped when Docker is unavailable.
- **Load tests** reside in `dev-tools/load-testing/src/gatling` and simulate real usage patterns. Run them with `./gradlew :load-testing:gatlingRun`. These tests also run in CI.

Test data seeding strategies use the `dev-tools/seed/seed-test-data.sh` script to populate a minimal world for local testing, and an automated approach seeds data for integration tests.

## Tooling and Gradle Layout

- **JUnit & Mockito** provide the core framework for unit and integration tests.
- **Spring Test** bootstraps service contexts and external resources.
- **Gatling** drives load testing scenarios.

The repository uses a hierarchical Gradle setup. The root `build.gradle.kts` delegates to per‑service builds. Each service exposes standard `test`, `integrationTest`, and cross‑service tasks. Example commands:

```bash
./gradlew :service-name:test
./gradlew :service-name:integrationTest
./gradlew crossServiceTest
```

Unit and integration tests run automatically in GitHub Actions through a matrix of `:service-name:check` tasks. Cross-service tests run via the `crossServiceTest` Gradle task.

## Cross-Service Integration Testing

For workflows that span multiple services, such as account creation and world provisioning, the suite starts several containers at once using **Testcontainers**. Each container joins a shared network so gRPC calls function just like in production.

### Example Workflow

1. Launch PostgreSQL and Redis containers.
2. Start Account, Game Session, and World Management services.
3. Perform a registration and login sequence to verify saga state.

```kotlin
val network = Network.newNetwork()
val postgres = PostgreSQLContainer<Nothing>("postgres:16").withNetwork(network)
val accountService = GenericContainer("account-service:latest").withNetwork(network)
```

This example uses a shared Testcontainers `Network` for cross-service orchestration.

These tests validate saga orchestration logic, and the `crossServiceTest` Gradle task runs them.

## CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions executes formatting and lint checks, builds the code, and runs all unit and integration tests via `:service-name:check` for each module. Coverage reports are generated and a Trivy security scan is executed. See the [CI/CD Pipeline](./system-architecture-cicd.md) document for the workflow definition.

Load testing is executed on demand outside of CI and does not block deployments.

### High-Concurrency Load Testing

Gatling scenarios simulate thousands of concurrent connections to measure service limits and uncover bottlenecks. Results guide scaling decisions and database indexing.

### Security Testing

OWASP ZAP crawls the web client and Gateway endpoints during CI to surface common web vulnerabilities. Penetration tests and rate-limiting checks run before major releases.
