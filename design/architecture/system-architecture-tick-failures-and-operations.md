# FireMUD Tick System: Failures & Operations

This document focuses on **failure modes, recovery flows, and operational guidance** for the tick system.

It is aimed at both developers and operators who need to understand what happens when executors crash, Redis has issues, or ticks must be replayed.

For the canonical, detailed design, see `design/architecture/system-architecture-ticks.md`.

## What This Covers

- Crash recovery and replay behavior.
- Idempotency rules tied to `tickId`.
- Handling stuck or partial tick entries.
- Design checklist for new tick-driven commands.

## Key Sections in the Main Tick Doc

The following sections in `system-architecture-ticks.md` contain the main failure-handling and operational rules:

- **Crash Recovery and Replay** – how executors recover from failure and resume processing safely.
- **Domain Idempotency Rules (TickId in PostgreSQL)** – how tick IDs enforce idempotent domain mutations.
- **Design Checklist for New Tick-Driven Commands** – review checklist for new commands to ensure they follow tick invariants.
- **Tick Execution and Redis Integration** – failure scenarios and invariants around the canonical commit pattern.
- **Cross-Region Command Execution and Result Relay** – constraints for cross-region retries and replay.

When implementing new failure-handling flows or adding operational procedures, ensure the detailed behavior is captured in `system-architecture-ticks.md` and reflected in the appropriate runbooks (for example, Redis incident runbooks).

## Stuck Pending Entries and Recovery

In rare cases, a `tick:{tenantRegionTag}:pending` entry may remain present even though repeated replays cannot complete successfully (for example, due to a persistent domain bug). A small recovery subsystem handles these **stuck ticks**:

- A background watcher scans metrics and/or a compact Redis/PostgreSQL index of `pending` entries to identify candidates, such as:
  - `pending` keys that have existed across multiple tick intervals with exhausted retries.
  - Regions where `tick:{tenantRegionTag}:pending` has not advanced despite repeated recovery attempts.
- Candidate stuck ticks are enqueued into a `tick_recovery` queue or table with metadata such as `<tenantId, regionId, tickId, firstSeenAt, lastRetryAt>`.
- An automated recovery worker:
  - Marks clearly terminal ticks as `FAILED` or `SKIPPED` in PostgreSQL using the same idempotency guards as normal handlers.
  - Clears `tick:{tenantRegionTag}:pending` and associated retry metadata via a dedicated, idempotent helper path.
  - Emits detailed logs and metrics for audit and dashboards.
- Operator tooling allows manual override for complex cases (for example, suspected data corruption), with two typical modes:
  - **Recommendation mode** – the system proposes recoveries; operators approve or override.
  - **Auto-recovery mode** – low-risk patterns are resolved automatically once thresholds are met.

Retry and timer queues are protected against unbounded growth:

- Retry queues (`retry:{tenantRegionTag}`) are ZSETs keyed by next-eligible execution time; scripts process at most `N` entries per invocation and enforce a maximum retry budget per action.
- Timer keys (`timer:{tenantRegionTag}`) are ZSETs keyed by due time; scripts pop at most `N` timers per call and delete processed members.
- Defensive limits (for example, maximum timers per region) trigger alerts or throttling if exceeded so bugs cannot create unbounded timer or retry growth.

Entity Management provides the reference example for per-aggregate tick idempotency; see `microservices/entity-management-service/README.md#tick-idempotency`.

## Remote Hint Markers and Resets

Cross-region flows may use best-effort Redis hint markers such as `remote:<tenantId>:<entityId>` or `remote:<tenantId>:<targetEntityId>` to reduce latency when draining remote follow-ups. Operationally:

- These markers are **latency hints only**:
  - They may be overwritten, duplicated, or lost.
  - Correctness is derived from durable follow-up rows in PostgreSQL, not from the presence of `remote:*` keys.
- Region-level coordination resets do not attempt to delete `remote:*` keys because these keys are tenant-scoped rather than region-scoped.
- After a region reset, the next tick executor:
  - Resumes draining due follow-ups from PostgreSQL into its normal tick pipeline.
  - Treats any stale or missing `remote:*` markers as affecting only how quickly it notices new work, not whether the work is eventually applied.

When debugging cross-region issues, operators should rely on PostgreSQL follow-up tables, tick effect ledgers, and the metrics described in the execution-flow docs rather than assuming `remote:*` keys are authoritative.
