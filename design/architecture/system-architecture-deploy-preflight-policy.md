# FireMUD Deployment Preflight Policy Contract

This document defines the authoritative preflight policy gate for staging and production deployments, plus the equivalent policy contract that player-facing hobby/self-hosted operators must run before opening traffic.

## Purpose

- Provide one deterministic preflight entrypoint used by both CI and operators.
- Ensure secret contracts, digest pinning, and bridge/security invariants are enforced before apply.
- Produce a reusable pass/fail artifact for deployment evidence.

## Bootstrap Contract

For a brand-new player-facing environment (`hobby-self-hosted`, `staging`, or `production`), preflight must verify the baseline trust and secret set before any workload apply. The minimum bootstrap set is:

- registry pull credentials for workload image access,
- PostgreSQL application credentials and admin rotation credentials when rotation Jobs are used,
- JWT signing and validation resources (`jwt-signing-keys`, `jwt-jwks`),
- cert-manager issuer or issuer reference for workload and bridge certificates,
- backup/object-store credentials when the environment requires backups,
- asset-store and outbound-communications credentials when those integrations are enabled,
- operator credential bindings required for environment-scoped control-plane access.

Bootstrap resources must be unique to the environment boundary. Reusing staging and production bootstrap secrets, buckets, or operator trust bindings is non-compliant.

## Authoritative Entrypoint

- Command: `./dev-tools/deploy/preflight.sh <staging|production|hobby-self-hosted>`
- Input: target environment and resolved overlay/manifests for that environment.
- `hobby-self-hosted` runs must provide an explicit render input via `FIREMUD_PREFLIGHT_RENDER_PATH`; falling back to the stage overlay is not an allowed substitute for hobby deployment validation.
- Output: non-zero exit code on failure and a machine-readable report artifact (for example JSON).
- Context:
  - `operator` (default): required checks are blocking for real applies.
  - `ci-static`: uses the same policy IDs/report schema but may mark runtime-only checks (for example production attestation when not in a production promotion flow) as `not_applicable`.

`hobby-self-hosted` deployments may use different packaging/manifests, but they must evaluate the same player-facing policy IDs that apply to their environment class and produce the same evidence shape.

## Enforcement Boundaries

- Overlay PR CI (`validate-kustomize-overlays.yml`) enforces static checks: digest pinning, image existence, attestation schema/digest matching, repository policy markers, and production backup-readiness binding when required.
- Operator pre-apply execution (`preflight.sh`) enforces resolved-manifest and target-environment checks: required secret/key contracts, JWT/JWKS contracts, Redis role split, bridge alignment, bootstrap completeness, and external integration isolation.
- Deployment apply is blocked unless required checks for the target class pass (or an explicit break-glass waiver is recorded).

## Environment Applicability

| Environment class | Overlay PR CI required | Operator preflight required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `staging` | Yes | Yes | Both gates mandatory before apply. |
| `production` | Yes | Yes | Both gates mandatory before apply. |
| `hobby-self-hosted` | Optional (recommended) | Yes | Operator preflight is mandatory; CI may be unavailable in single-operator setups. |

## Required Policy Checks

Every run must emit one result per policy ID below, with status `pass`, `fail`, or `not_applicable` (with reason):

- `PREFLIGHT-DIGEST-001` – all staging/production workload images are immutable digests (`image@sha256:...`).
- `PREFLIGHT-DIGEST-002` – hobby/self-hosted workload manifests are digest-pinned where the operator packaging format supports digest references.
- `PREFLIGHT-SECRETS-001` – required Secrets and keys exist for the target environment.
- `PREFLIGHT-SECRETS-002` – player-facing environments validate internal state/trust bindings (PostgreSQL endpoint and credential binding, Redis role endpoints, JWT/JWKS resource bindings, certificate issuer binding, registry pull credentials) against the target environment and fail on cross-environment reuse.
- `PREFLIGHT-JWT-001` – player-facing environments use `FIREMUD_AUTH_JWT_SECRET_PATH` and do not rely on inline-only JWT secrets.
- `PREFLIGHT-JWKS-001` – JWKS resource type matches environment policy (`jwt-jwks` Secret for player-facing environments; ConfigMap only for explicitly non-player-facing/test environments).
- `PREFLIGHT-BRIDGE-001` – `GATEWAY_WS_URL` matches the expected internal Gateway listener for the target environment.
- `PREFLIGHT-REDIS-001` – player-facing environments resolve distinct Coordination vs Cache Redis endpoints.
- `PREFLIGHT-BOOTSTRAP-001` – player-facing environments confirm the minimum bootstrap secret and trust resources exist before apply.
- `PREFLIGHT-EXTERNAL-001` – player-facing environments validate that backup storage, asset storage, outbound communications, and operator credential bindings match the target environment and do not cross environment boundaries.
- `PREFLIGHT-SERVICES-001` – player-facing environments either run with default in-environment service discovery or declare explicit `FIREMUD_SERVICES_*` overrides that are allowlisted for the target environment and do not resolve across environment boundaries.
- `PREFLIGHT-PROMOTION-001` – production promotions reference a valid staging attestation with matching digests.
- `PREFLIGHT-BACKUP-001` – production `roll-forward-only` promotions include fresh backup-readiness evidence, including canonical coordinated-backup scope and a recovery drill that produced the required recovery evidence chain.
- `PREFLIGHT-BACKUP-002` – production first-live or traffic-reopen events verify at least one successful logical backup upload and one successful backup verification result for the environment before traffic is opened.
- `PREFLIGHT-BACKUP-003` – hobby/self-hosted first-live or traffic-reopen events verify current backup-baseline compliance evidence before player traffic is opened.

Policy applicability:

- `PREFLIGHT-PROMOTION-001` is required for `production` and `not_applicable` for `staging` and `hobby-self-hosted`.
- `PREFLIGHT-BACKUP-001` is required for `production` when the referenced attestation classifies the release as `roll-forward-only`, and `not_applicable` otherwise. This check fails when backup evidence relies on alias-scoped coordinated backups or on a restore drill that did not produce the required recovery record lineage.
- `PREFLIGHT-BACKUP-002` is required for `production` on first-live opens and reopen-after-restore events, and `not_applicable` for routine steady-state rollouts that do not change traffic-open status.
- `PREFLIGHT-BACKUP-003` is required for `hobby-self-hosted` on first-live opens and reopen-after-restore events, and `not_applicable` otherwise. This check validates both `design/operations/deployments/hobby-self-hosted/backup-compliance.yaml` and `design/operations/deployments/hobby-self-hosted/traffic-open/<deployment-ref>.json` for the current event.
- `PREFLIGHT-DIGEST-001` is required for any flow using Kustomize overlays (`staging`, `production`) and `not_applicable` for `hobby-self-hosted`.
- `PREFLIGHT-DIGEST-002` is recommended/advisory for `hobby-self-hosted` and `not_applicable` for `staging`/`production`.
- `PREFLIGHT-SECRETS-002`, `PREFLIGHT-BOOTSTRAP-001`, `PREFLIGHT-EXTERNAL-001`, and `PREFLIGHT-SERVICES-001` are required for all player-facing environments.

## Canonical Expected-Binding Inputs

`PREFLIGHT-EXTERNAL-001` must validate the target environment against one canonical expected-binding input set so deployment preflight and restore validation use the same contract.

Canonical source:

- `design/operations/environments/<environment>/expected-bindings.yaml`

Minimum required keys:

- `internalBindings.postgres.endpoint`
- `internalBindings.postgres.credentialsRef`
- `internalBindings.redis.coordination.endpoint`
- `internalBindings.redis.cache.endpoint`
- `internalBindings.jwt.signingKeysRef`
- `internalBindings.jwt.jwksRef`
- `internalBindings.certificates.issuerRef`
- `internalBindings.registry.imagePullSecretRef`
- `backupStorage.bucket`
- `backupStorage.endpoint` when using a non-default S3-compatible endpoint
- `assetStorage.bucket`
- `assetStorage.endpoint`
- `outboundComms.smtpHost` and/or environment-classified webhook target identifiers
- `operatorCredentials.bindingRef` or `operatorCredentials.fingerprint`

Service-discovery policy keys:

- `serviceDiscovery.mode` with value `kubernetes-dns-default` or `explicit-overrides`
- `serviceDiscovery.allowedOverrides` when `mode=explicit-overrides`

Service-discovery validation rule:

- In player-facing environments, `serviceDiscovery.mode: kubernetes-dns-default` is the default and preferred contract.
- If a player-facing environment must set any `FIREMUD_SERVICES_*` override, the manifest must use `serviceDiscovery.mode: explicit-overrides` and list every permitted override key/value pair under `serviceDiscovery.allowedOverrides`.
- Any undeclared override, or any declared override that resolves outside the target environment boundary, fails `PREFLIGHT-SERVICES-001`.

Operator credential representation rule:

- Use `operatorCredentials.bindingRef` when the environment binds operator access through a platform-native resource identifier (for example a cert-manager certificate binding, workload identity binding, or a named operator Secret reference).
- Use `operatorCredentials.fingerprint` when the environment contract is anchored to a concrete certificate or key fingerprint rather than a stable platform binding identifier.
- If both are available, `bindingRef` is the canonical expected-binding field and `fingerprint` may be included as supporting validation detail rather than a second competing source of truth.

Illustrative example:

```yaml
environment: staging
internalBindings:
  postgres:
    endpoint: postgres.firemud.svc.cluster.local:5432
    credentialsRef: secret://firemud/postgres-credentials
  redis:
    coordination:
      endpoint: redis-coord.firemud.svc.cluster.local:6379
    cache:
      endpoint: redis-cache.firemud.svc.cluster.local:6379
  jwt:
    signingKeysRef: secret://firemud/jwt-signing-keys
    jwksRef: secret://firemud/jwt-jwks
  certificates:
    issuerRef: cert-manager://firemud/clusterissuers/firemud-staging
  registry:
    imagePullSecretRef: secret://firemud/ghcr-pull-staging
backupStorage:
  bucket: firemud-staging-backups
  endpoint: https://minio.staging.internal
assetStorage:
  bucket: firemud-staging-assets
  endpoint: https://minio.staging.internal
outboundComms:
  smtpHost: smtp.staging.internal
  webhookTargets:
    accountNotifications: staging-only
operatorCredentials:
  bindingRef: cert-manager://firemud/staging-operator-client
serviceDiscovery:
  mode: kubernetes-dns-default
```

Illustrative intentionally shared non-sensitive field:

```yaml
observability:
  otelCollectorEndpoint:
    value: https://otel.shared.internal:4317
    shared: true
    sharedRationale: shared collector endpoint; credentials and tenant separation remain environment-specific
```

Validation contract:

- Preflight fails if the manifest is missing for a player-facing environment.
- The resolved deployment inputs must match the manifest for the target environment.
- The manifest must prove environment isolation. Staging and production cannot share PostgreSQL endpoints/credential bindings, Redis endpoints, JWT/JWKS bindings, certificate issuer bindings, registry pull credentials, bucket names, endpoints, SMTP targets, webhook target classes, or operator credential bindings unless the field is explicitly documented as non-sensitive shared infrastructure.
- When a field is intentionally shared, the manifest must mark it explicitly with `shared: true` plus a short `sharedRationale` string. Absence of those fields means the binding is treated as environment-unique by default.
- Restore validation tooling may derive shell environment variables such as `EXPECTED_PG_DUMP_BUCKET`, `EXPECTED_ASSET_STORE_BUCKET`, `EXPECTED_ASSET_STORE_ENDPOINT`, `EXPECTED_SMTP_HOST`, and operator-binding fingerprints from this manifest rather than maintaining a second source of truth.
- When validating operator-only credentials, preflight should compare like-for-like against the expected binding form: compare `bindingRef` values when the manifest declares `bindingRef`, and compare fingerprints when the manifest declares `fingerprint`. Implementations should not invent a second canonical representation during validation.
- Preflight should validate player-facing internal state/trust inputs from the same manifest rather than treating them as implicit cluster-local defaults. Cluster-local naming alone is not sufficient proof of environment isolation.
- Deployment and recovery evidence must reference the same manifest path so auditors can answer “what binding did we expect?” from one record family.

## Evidence Contract

The report artifact must include:

- `environment`
- `deploymentRef` object with one of:
  - `overlayCommitSha` for overlay-driven deployments (`staging`, `production`), or
  - `manifestRef` / `chartVersion` for hobby/self-hosted deployments.
- `checkResults[]` with `policyId`, `status`, `message`
- `expectedBindingsRef` for player-facing environments
- `startedAt` and `completedAt` timestamps
- `toolVersion`

For `ci-static` runs, `expectedBindingsRef` should point to the same repository path that operator preflight would use for the target environment, even when CI validates only static contracts and not live cluster bindings.

Illustrative `ci-static` report shape:

```json
{
  "environment": "staging",
  "deploymentRef": {
    "overlayCommitSha": "abc123def456"
  },
  "checkResults": [
    {
      "policyId": "PREFLIGHT-DIGEST-001",
      "status": "pass",
      "message": "all images are digest pinned"
    }
  ],
  "expectedBindingsRef": "design/operations/environments/staging/expected-bindings.yaml",
  "startedAt": "2026-03-13T08:00:00Z",
  "completedAt": "2026-03-13T08:00:03Z",
  "toolVersion": "preflight/v1"
}
```

CI and manual operator runs must produce the same report shape so audit tooling can compare them.

### Evidence Storage and Retention

- Preflight report artifacts are stored in-repo under:
  - `design/operations/deployments/<environment>/preflight/<deployment-ref>.json`
- Break-glass waivers are stored beside the report artifact as:
  - `design/operations/deployments/<environment>/preflight/<deployment-ref>.waiver.json`
- `deployment-ref` is:
  - `<overlayCommitSha>` for overlay-driven staging/production deployments, or
  - a normalized manifest/chart reference token for hobby/self-hosted deployments.
- Naming rule: `<deployment-ref>` and similar artifact tokens must use lowercase ASCII plus digits and `-`, and should be stable across re-runs of the same deployment event so evidence does not fork accidentally.
- Retention requirement: keep preflight reports and waivers for at least as long as release/rollback audit history is retained.
- Waiver records must include: approver identity, incident/change ticket, scope (policy IDs waived), expiration (deployment event only), and timestamp.

## Failure Handling

- Any failed required check blocks deployment.
- Waivers are break-glass only, must be explicit, and must include approver + incident/change ticket in the report.
- Waivers expire after the specific deployment event and must not silently carry forward.
