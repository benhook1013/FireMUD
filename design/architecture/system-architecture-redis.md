## Redis Coordination Invariants

FireMUD uses Redis as a **transient, high‑performance coordination layer**, not as a primary source of truth. The following invariants apply to all coordination designs:

- **Non‑authoritative for game data**
  - Canonical game state (accounts, entities, items, rooms, instances) lives in PostgreSQL and domain services.
  - Redis holds **volatile coordination state**: tick queues and locks, timers, session bindings, automation hints, retry metadata, and similar.
  - Losing coordination state within a bounded window must not create irreversible financial effects, cross‑tenant data leaks, or unfixable domain inconsistencies.

- **Tail‑loss envelope**
  - Coordination Redis is configured with AOF and sized so that **only a small tail** of recent coordination state per `<tenantId, regionId>` may be lost during failover or restart (on the order of **1–2 seconds** of activity in production‑like environments).
  - Designs must tolerate the loss of a few ticks’ worth of:
    - Commands, staged effects, timers, and retry markers, and
    - Session liveness hints and other advisory metadata.
  - Flows that **cannot** tolerate this tail‑loss (for example, real‑money purchases, cross‑tenant transfers, or unique external side effects) must use durable domain mechanisms and may only use Redis for optional coordination.

- **Idempotent replay and monotonic guards**
  - Tick and session scripts are designed so that:
    - AOF replay cannot double‑apply logical effects, and
    - Replays after failover respect monotonic guards such as `tickId`, `generation` counters, and lease/lock tokens.
  - Lua scripts must treat Redis as the single coordination state for their keys, re‑deriving their desired state from current contents and arguments rather than relying on in‑process history.

- **Region authority**
  - For each `<tenantId, regionId>` there is at most **one active tick executor** at a time, guarded by a region‑scoped lease key.
  - All tick queues, locks, timers, and pending sets for that region live in a single hash‑slot‑compatible keyspace (see [Key Naming and Shard Discipline](#key-naming-and-shard-discipline)).

- **Session binding**
  - Session keys in Redis bind player connections, tick participation, and cooldown state to authenticated platform identities.
  - Session binding is monotonic: once a session is rebound or terminated, old bindings are not resurrected, even under replay or tail‑loss.

The **Redis Design Checklist** (`system-architecture-redis-design-checklist.md`) turns these invariants into concrete review steps for new prefixes, scripts, and flows.

### Redis Availability, Consistency, and Safety Guarantees

From an application perspective:

- Coordination Redis is expected to be **highly available** within the limits of the chosen profile (for example, `production_clustered`).
- Tail-loss is bounded to a **small window** per `<tenantId, regionId>`; losing more than this window is treated as an incident and investigated using the metrics and alerts defined in `system-architecture-redis-operations.md`.
- Lua scripts and domain idempotency guarantees ensure that replay and partial loss of coordination keys do not:
  - Double-apply critical effects.
  - Violate cross-tenant isolation.
  - Break financial or security invariants.

Operational details (failover behavior, AOF expectations, and tail-loss observability) are expanded in `system-architecture-redis-operations.md` and `system-architecture-redis-reset-and-recovery.md`.

---

## Atomicity and Concurrency Control

Multi-key coordination operations in FireMUD must remain **shard-local, idempotent, and lease-guarded**:

- All mutating operations on coordination prefixes (tick queues, `pending` sets, timers, retry structures, locks, leases, and session keys) are performed via registered **Lua scripts** that:
  - Validate lease tokens, lock tokens, and monotonic guards (`tickId`, epochs) before writing.
  - Operate only on keys that share the same hash tag and cluster slot.
  - Are deterministic and idempotent with respect to their `KEYS`/`ARGV` arguments and current Redis state.
- Application code and maintenance tooling must **not** issue ad-hoc multi-key Redis commands (including `MULTI/EXEC`) over coordination prefixes.
- Cross-region workflows are implemented as per-region operations or higher-level sagas, not as cross-region Redis transactions.

The detailed scripting rules and categories (region-lease scripts, session-only scripts, automation scripts, maintenance scripts) are defined in `system-architecture-redis-lua-patterns.md`, and the concrete checks to apply during design review are captured in the Lua section of `system-architecture-redis-design-checklist.md`.

## Session Keys and Gameplay Binding

Redis stores transient gameplay session state for each connected player under keys of the form:

- `session:game:<tenantId>:<sessionId>`

These keys capture:

- Socket binding metadata and transport details.
- Active `playerId` / `tenantId` context.
- Tick-region participation and queued commands.
- Timer and cooldown state associated with the session.

Key properties:

- `sessionId` is an opaque, server-generated identifier (for example, a UUID or fixed-length hash) chosen so key length stays bounded and independent of the raw JWT or account token.
- Session entries use a **derived session TTL** computed from authentication settings (see `infrastructure/environment-and-secrets.md#authentication`):
  - A logical expiry timestamp is stored inside the session value.
  - The Redis TTL for `session:game:<tenantId>:<sessionId>` is set to the same derived duration when the session is created or refreshed.
- The logical expiry timestamp is the **authoritative bound** on reconnection:
  - Reconnect/resume attempts are rejected as expired once the logical expiry has passed, even if the Redis TTL has not yet removed the key (for example, due to AOF replay or failover drift).
  - When either the key is missing or the logical expiry has passed, the session is treated as non-resumable and requires a fresh `LOGIN`.
- The derived `session_expiration_ms` window is computed as:
  - `session_expiration_ms = FIREMUD_AUTH_JWT_EXPIRATION_MS + FIREMUD_AUTH_SESSION_SAFETY_MARGIN_MS`
  - This ensures the reconnection window is aligned with JWT lifetime; operators who want a shorter window should reduce `FIREMUD_AUTH_JWT_EXPIRATION_MS` rather than introducing a separate “session TTL” knob.

Session design assumes **reasonably synchronized clocks** on Game Session nodes (for example, via NTP); large clock skew is treated as an infrastructure misconfiguration, not a normal edge case of the session protocol. The combination of JWT expiry, derived session TTL, and Redis TTL defines the maximum reconnection window; TTL acts as garbage collection, while logical expiry governs gameplay semantics.

### Operational Trade-Offs for Session TTL vs JWT Lifetime

The coupling between `session_expiration_ms` and JWT lifetime is intentional:

- It avoids drift between “how long a JWT is valid” and “how long a Redis session can be resumed”.
- It keeps the reconnection window easy to reason about for both operators and game designers.

When changing authentication settings, keep these trade-offs in mind:

- **Shorter JWT lifetime, shorter reconnect window**
  - Reducing `FIREMUD_AUTH_JWT_EXPIRATION_MS` directly shrinks both authentication TTL and reconnection TTL.
  - Use this when you want stricter auth/security guarantees and are comfortable with players needing to re-authenticate more often after disconnects.
- **Longer reconnect window**
  - To lengthen the reconnection window without materially weakening JWT lifetime, prefer increasing `FIREMUD_AUTH_SESSION_SAFETY_MARGIN_MS` in small, documented increments rather than introducing a separate “session TTL” knob.
  - Document any non-default safety margin in environment docs so operators understand that reconnects can remain valid slightly past JWT expiry, but always within a bounded, intentional window.
- **Unsupported combinations**
  - Do not add independent per-environment or per-tenant “session TTL” controls that diverge from `session_expiration_ms`; they make reconnection semantics harder to reason about and are considered out of scope for this design.
  - If requirements emerge that truly need a different model (for example, long-lived reconnect windows with very short JWTs), they should be captured as a dedicated design change that revisits the coupling in this section rather than as ad-hoc overrides.

For full details on how session keys integrate with reconnect and takeover flows, see:

- Authentication & Authorization (`system-architecture-authentication.md`)
- Reconnection Strategy (`system-architecture-reconnection.md`)
- Game Session Service Redis keys (`microservices/game-session-service/README.md#redis-keys`)

Tenant-scoped authentication/session allowlist entries (`session:auth:<tenantId>:<tokenHash>`) share the same TTL derivation and reset expectations as gameplay sessions, but are documented in detail in `system-architecture-authentication.md` and the Account Service design; they live on Coordination Redis so resets can force re-authentication in a controlled way.

---

## Redis Profiles

Redis deployments approximate one of a small set of **profiles**. These profiles describe the expected persistence, restart behavior, and SLO assumptions for Coordination Redis:

- **`dev_local`**
  - Used for individual developers and lightweight local stacks.
  - AOF enabled on Coordination Redis, primarily for debugging and replay during development.
  - Tail‑loss SLOs are relaxed, but invariants and key naming rules still apply.

- **`hobby_self_hosted`**
  - For small/self‑hosted player‑facing deployments.
  - Coordination Redis runs with AOF enabled and memory sizing tuned so restarts typically complete within **30–60 seconds**.
  - Tail‑loss envelopes and replay guarantees are expected to match production‑like behavior for a single tenant.

- **`production_clustered`**
  - For multi‑tenant or higher scale environments.
  - Coordination Redis runs as a cluster or carefully sized single‑node deployment with AOF, predictable restart times, and shard sizing aligned with tick workloads.
  - Tail‑loss SLOs, availability SLOs, and incident playbooks are evaluated against this profile.

Environments (local, CI, staging, production) are mapped to these profiles and their concrete settings in **Redis Usage & Profiles** (`system-architecture-redis-usage-and-profiles.md`).

## Redis as a Volatile State Layer

Redis is used **exclusively** for non‑authoritative, transient data, including:

- In‑flight command queues and tick staging structures.
- Tick locks and executor leases.
- Timers, cooldowns, and retry metadata (stored in milliseconds).
- Gameplay session state and live coordination (session bindings, queue participation).
- Best‑effort caches for hot‑path aggregates and chat history in Cache/Rate‑Limit Redis.
- Automation queues and coordination hints that can be reconstructed from durable domain state.

Implications:

- Losing keys within the tail‑loss envelope must behave like lost/reordered messages or delayed timers, not permanent data corruption.
- Designs must **never** put the only record of a critical effect (for example, a currency transfer) exclusively in Redis.
- Every new use of Redis must explicitly state:
  - Which role it targets (Coordination vs Cache/Rate‑Limit).
  - Whether it is reset‑tolerant, reset‑sensitive, or reset‑forbidden.
  - How it behaves under tail‑loss and during coordination resets.

The **Redis Usage & Profiles** and **Redis Cache & Rate Limiting** docs expand on role‑specific expectations, eviction behavior, and cache correctness classes.

---

## Key Naming and Shard Discipline

Redis keys follow strict naming conventions to ensure:

- Shard‑aware key locality and safe multi‑key Lua scripts.
- Clean separation between Coordination and Cache/Rate‑Limit workloads.
- Tenant and region isolation in shared clusters.

Key principles:

- **Tenant and region prefixes**
  - All coordination and cache keys include a `tenantId` component.
  - Many coordination keys also include a `regionId` so tick workloads and timers can be scoped per region.
  - Human‑readable values (character names, room titles) are **never** embedded directly in keys; only stable identifiers (numeric IDs, UUIDs) appear in key components.

- **`{tenantRegionTag}` hash tag**
  - Tick‑region coordination keys use a canonical hash tag placeholder `{tenantRegionTag}` derived from `<tenantId, regionId>`.
  - Properties:
    - The concrete string format is an implementation detail of shared key helpers; callers treat it as opaque.
    - All region‑scoped keys for a given region share the same `{tenantRegionTag}` and therefore land in the same Redis Cluster slot.
    - Multi‑key coordination scripts must only receive keys that share the same hash tag; CI and helpers enforce this.
  - Representative patterns:
    - `tick:{tenantRegionTag}:lock:<entityId>`
    - `tick:{tenantRegionTag}:pending`
    - `timer:{tenantRegionTag}`
    - `retry:{tenantRegionTag}`
    - `tick-executor-lease:{tenantRegionTag}`

- **Coordination vs cache prefixes**
  - Coordination prefixes (for example `tick:*`, `timer:*`, `retry:*`, `session:*`, `tick-executor-lease:*`) live **only** on Coordination Redis.
  - Cache and rate‑limit prefixes (for example `inventory:*`, `view:room-look:*`, `ratelimit:*`) live **only** on Cache/Rate‑Limit Redis.
  - New prefixes must be registered in the canonical catalogs:
    - Coordination prefixes and their reset policies belong in the reset policy matrix and any extended catalogs in `system-architecture-redis-reset-and-recovery.md`.
    - Cache/rate-limit prefixes belong in the Cache/Rate-Limit Key Catalog in `system-architecture-redis-cache.md`, including their correctness class and reset tolerance.
  - For each new or changed prefix, designs must record:
    - Role (Coordination vs Cache/Rate‑Limit).
    - Tail‑loss and reset behavior (reset‑tolerant, reset‑sensitive, or reset‑forbidden).
    - Expected owners and usage patterns, and links to the relevant service README sections.

The **Redis Cheat Sheet** maintains a representative prefix → role/owner mapping. The **Redis Design Checklist** includes concrete checks to run before adding or changing any prefix.

### Coordination Key Examples

This table lists representative coordination keys and their responsibilities. Full semantics live in service‑specific docs and Lua descriptors, but these examples provide a quick mental model:

| Redis Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `tick:{tenantRegionTag}:lock:<entityId>` | Lock for an entity during tick execution within a region. |
| `tick:{tenantRegionTag}:pending` | Staged results for a tick region (single in‑flight tick). |
| `tick:{tenantRegionTag}:queue:<entityId>` | Per‑entity command queue within a region. |
| `retry:{tenantRegionTag}` | Retry queue for failed actions. |
| `timer:{tenantRegionTag}` | Sorted set of timers for a region; score is expiration timestamp (ms), members encode entity/effect metadata. |
| `remote:<tenantId>:<entityId>` | Best‑effort hint marker for cross‑region follow‑ups (durable follow‑ups live in PostgreSQL). |
| `automation:tick:{tenantScriptTag}:lock` / `queue` / `pending` | Per‑script automation tick locks and staging (Automation & Scripting Service). |
| `script-scheduler:{tenantRegionTag}:lastTickId` | Automation & Scripting scheduler checkpoint for “every N ticks” triggers; used to resume interval counting after leader changes. |

Region‑scoped coordination keys share the same `{tenantRegionTag}` hash tag and therefore land in the same Redis Cluster slot. Tenant‑scoped session/auth keys and other single‑key prefixes do not require a hash tag but must still honour the coordination vs cache role split described above.

## Topology Compatibility Overview
## Topology Compatibility Overview

Redis features and assumptions in FireMUD must work across both single‑instance and clustered deployments. This table summarizes what is supported; operational details and exact configuration live in **Redis Usage & Profiles** and **Redis Operations & Migrations**.

| Topology | Coordination Usage | Cache/Rate‑Limit Usage | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Single‑node with AOF (coordination) | **Supported.** All coordination prefixes (`tick:*`, `timer:*`, `retry:*`, `session:*`, `tick-executor-lease:*`, etc.) and shard‑local Lua patterns apply. Tail‑loss envelopes and AOF replay guarantees assume this profile or better. | **Supported** on a separate Cache/Rate‑Limit deployment (distinct process or container). | Recommended baseline for `dev_local` and `hobby_self_hosted` profiles. |
| Single‑node without AOF (ephemeral coordination) | **Supported only for explicitly ephemeral stacks** (preview/CI) that opt out of tail‑loss SLOs and replay guarantees. Coordination keys are disposable and must be reset‑tolerant. | **Supported** on a separate Cache/Rate‑Limit deployment; cache behavior is unchanged. | Not appropriate for environments where tick replay, tail‑loss SLOs, or long‑lived coordination logs are required. |
| Redis Cluster (coordination) | **Supported** provided all coordination Lua scripts obey shard‑local rules using `{tenantRegionTag}` hash tags. Multi‑key coordination scripts must only touch keys that share a hash tag and slot. | **Supported** for cache/rate‑limit workloads; rate‑limit prefixes (`ratelimit:*`) are treated as single‑key operations without cross‑slot atomicity. | Cluster deployment requires strict adherence to hash‑tag and slotting rules described in [Key Naming and Shard Discipline](#key-naming-and-shard-discipline). |

In all topologies:

- Coordination Redis and Cache/Rate‑Limit Redis are **separate deployments** (distinct processes/containers) even when they share the same host or Kubernetes node.
- Application and tooling configuration **must not** point `FIREMUD_REDIS_COORD_*` and `FIREMUD_REDIS_CACHE_*` to the same endpoint in any non‑ephemeral environment.
- Shared configuration helpers should perform a best‑effort check (for example, comparing host/port pairs) and emit a clear log/health warning when both roles resolve to the same target.

## External Invariants Redis Depends On

Redis designs in FireMUD assume several invariants that are defined and enforced in other parts of the system. This section summarizes the most important ones so Redis reviews do not have to repeatedly re-derive them:

- **Region epoch and single-writer guarantees**
  - The tick system maintains a `region_epoch` per `<tenantId, regionId>` in PostgreSQL (see `system-architecture-tick-concepts-and-invariants.md` and related docs).
  - At any time, at most one executor is allowed to hold the active epoch for a region; Lua scripts validate epoch and lease tokens against this metadata.
  - Redis designs may assume that “single writer per region + epoch” is upheld by the tick control plane and database, and must treat violations (for example, split-brain) as incidents that trigger resets, not normal control flow.
- **Idempotent domain effects**
  - Domain-level effects (damage application, currency transfers, quest progress, etc.) are recorded via idempotent identifiers or transaction rows in PostgreSQL (see `system-architecture-transactions.md`).
  - Coordination keys such as `pending` entries and retries rely on these idempotency guards: re-running ticks or retries must not double-apply domain effects even if Redis state is replayed or partially lost within the tail-loss envelope.
- **Transactional boundaries**
  - Services that participate in ticks and coordination flows encapsulate their durable writes in transactions with clear boundaries and conflict detection (for example, optimistic locking or explicit version checks).
  - Redis designs may assume that “commit vs rollback” is visible in domain state and must not introduce coordination patterns that require peeking into in-flight, uncommitted work.
- **Authentication and session semantics**
  - Session TTLs and reconnect windows follow the authentication settings described in `system-architecture-authentication.md` and `system-architecture-reconnection.md`.
  - Session-related Redis keys (`session:game:*`) are expected to enforce those logical expiry rules; Redis designs must not introduce independent notions of “session lifetime” that diverge from the documented auth contracts.

When changing any of these external invariants, update this section and the referenced docs together so Redis designs and reset/runbook assumptions remain aligned.
