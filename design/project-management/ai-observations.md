# AI Observations

Append-only notes for recurring friction, surprising behavior, environment issues, inefficient patterns, code smells, and "this should be shaped better" patterns discovered during AI work.

Entry dates use Pacific/Auckland unless stated otherwise.

Only keep entries whose lesson still matters after the immediate task is done. Do not use this file as a bug log for ordinary fixes that were completed in the same piece of work. Prefer logging reusable observations that suggest a better repo rule, CI guard, design refinement, or shared implementation pattern.

During ordinary autonomous work, this file is append-only: add dated reusable observations, and do not silently rewrite or delete prior entries. Workers should append reusable observations, helpers should send candidate entries to the owning worker, and ordinary bugs fixed in the same work should not become entries. Explicitly assigned Overseer stewardship may consume entries under the bounded process in [AI delegation and review](../developer-workflows/ai-delegation-and-review.md); a human-requested [repository health check](../developer-workflows/repository-health-check.md) separately authorizes the worker to remove an entry only after evidence shows that it is addressed, obsolete, or disproved. Retain an entry only when a genuine blocker or deliberate postponement remains, recording the reason and reconsideration trigger. A health-check pass should reduce this inbox toward zero.

Entry format:

- `YYYY-MM-DD`: short title
  - Context: where it appeared
  - Observation: what was surprising or wasteful
  - Expected pattern: what should happen instead

- `2026-09-09`: Bind cert-manager Secret bytes to durable issuance evidence
  - Context: a hosted identity controller initially treated a ready Certificate revision and a separately read TLS Secret as one issuance snapshot during renewal.
  - Observation: cert-manager writes the Secret before advancing Certificate status, so independent reads can combine different revisions; Ready status and Secret metadata do not prove that the observed certificate bytes belong to the recorded revision.
  - Expected pattern: select the uniquely owned CertificateRequest for the ready revision, require its issued certificate bytes to match the Secret exactly, carry those validated bytes forward, and re-read the Certificate snapshot before acceptance. Treat absent or ambiguous issuance evidence as retryable and remember that `CertificateRequest.status.ca` is optional.
  - Current status: [PR #2853](https://github.com/benhook1013/FireMUD/pull/2853) owns the source-side TLS rotation and hosted identity proof work. Its current scope does not prove that live CertificateRequest bytes equal the TLS Secret, that the Ready Certificate snapshot is re-read afterward, or that the served identity uses the rotated certificate; these checks remain an activation gate.
  - Reconsideration trigger: revisit during an authorized activation or renewal observation that can compare the uniquely owned CertificateRequest bytes with the TLS Secret and re-read the Ready Certificate snapshot.

- `2026-09-20`: Workflow-code fixes need an environment-policy cutover for old branches
  - Context: preview deployment secrets were available to a branch-selectable workflow on a persistent self-hosted runner; new workflow code routes privileged jobs through the default branch.
  - Observation: an existing PR branch can retain its old workflow revision after the corrected default-branch workflow merges, and an unrestricted GitHub environment can still release secrets to that old revision.
  - Expected pattern: alongside the code change, restrict privileged GitHub environments to the trusted deployment branch and clear or rotate credentials exposed by old runner state; verify the live environment policies before declaring the trust boundary effective.
  - Current status: The live `trusted-hosted-cluster` Environment allows only `develop`; its environment-scoped secret-name list is empty, while repository secrets still include legacy `PREVIEW_KUBECONFIG`. The scoped credential bootstrap/finalization, token rotation, legacy binding removal, and old-identity RBAC denial proof remain unverified.
  - Reconsideration trigger: before the next privileged deployment or declaring cutover complete, an authorized operator should provision and verify the canonical scoped credentials, finalize removal and revocation of the legacy credential and binding, and prove the old identity cannot read Secrets, create CertificateRequests, or change an Issuer. Secret-name presence or absence alone is not rotation or RBAC proof.
